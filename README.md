# Aether
An endgame challenge to distill the very fabric of reality and harness it's power.
## Features
* Obsidian Pot: Used to create pure mese and pure diamond. Suround one with 8 lava source blocks to use. Right click with eaither a mese crystal or a diamond to melt it in the pot. After a few seconds, half of the contents of the pot will evaporate, leaving you with slightly more pure mese or diamond. Right click the half full pot with another half full pot of the same purity and repeat until you have a pot with 100% diamond or mese. Place this pot in the center of 8 ice blocks to reharden the mixture into a crystal.

* Elemental Fuser: Used to create fire, air, earth, and water infused diamonds. Insert *pure* diamond and mese into their respective slots, and then follow the recipes detailed bellow. 

* Aether Reactor: Used to distill aether. Craft a fire, air, earth, and water stabilizer, as well as an aether reactor core. Right click the core with essence of aether to activate it. Activate the four stabilizers by placing them with three blocks of space between them and the active rector core (black side facing the core), then right clicking them with a pure mese crystal. <br>Then comes the real challenge: insert one of every craftable item into the core. Right click on the core to see a list of the items needed and the inventory slot to put them in. <br>After everything is done, right click the core with one more pure mese crystal to make aether! After 15 seconds (in which some funky stuff happens to the sky), a block of aether will replace the reactor core.

* Aether Imbued Items: After you obtain a block of aether, in adition to making a nice trophie, you can craft it with a number of oridnary objects (such as paper, saplings, and glass fragments) to gain various abilities (such as flight, invisibilty, and super speed). Generally, you gain these abilities while holding the object. Aether infused stone is unbreakable to everyone but it's placer, and an aether infused stick functions as a powerful shovel/sword/axe/pickaxe combination.
